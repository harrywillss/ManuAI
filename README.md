# ManuAI 🦜 - New Zealand Bird Sound Classification

A machine learning project that classifies New Zealand bird sounds using Vision Transformer (ViT) models fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on mel spectrogram representations of audio recordings.

## 🎯 Project Overview

ManuAI transforms bird audio recordings into mel spectrograms and uses computer vision techniques to classify different New Zealand bird species. The project leverages the unique approach of treating audio classification as an image classification problem, using Google's Vision Transformer (ViT) model fine-tuned with LoRA for efficient training.

### Key Features

- **Audio-to-Image Conversion**: Converts bird audio recordings to mel spectrograms for visual processing
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Efficient parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained ViT models
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implements weighted loss functions to handle imbalanced datasets
- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Complete pipeline from data download to model training
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with configurable early stopping callbacks

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

Follow these steps to train and use ManuAI:

1. **Download Data**
   - Run `download_data.py` to fetch New Zealand bird recordings from Xeno-canto.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python download_data.py
     ```

2. **Preprocess Data**
   - Run `preprocess_data.py` to segment and convert audio files into mel spectrograms.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python preprocess_data.py
     ```

3. **Fine-tune the Model**
   - Open and run all cells in `lora-finetune.ipynb` to fine-tune the Vision Transformer model using LoRA.

4. **Run Inference**
   - Use `inference.py` to classify new bird audio samples.
   - 
See each script/notebook for additional options and configuration details.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses bird recordings from [Xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/), a citizen science project focused on sharing bird sounds from around the world.

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Download**: Fetches New Zealand bird recordings via Xeno-canto API
2. **Segmentation**: Splits recordings into 4-second segments
3. **Quality Filtering**: Removes low-quality or silent segments
4. **Spectrogram Conversion**: Converts audio to mel spectrograms
5. **Augmentation**: Applies data augmentation techniques

### Supported Bird Species

The model currently supports classification of 10 New Zealand bird species including:
- Tui (*Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae*)
- Bellbird (*Anthornis melanura*)
- Kaka (*Nestor meridionalis*)
- Robin (*Petroica* species)
- Morepork (*Ninox novaeseelandiae*)
- Fantail (*Rhipidura fuliginosa*)
- And many more...
